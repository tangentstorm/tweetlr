* Tweetlr

Tweetlr is an open-source social media experience for hipsters on the go.

It's also a tiny twitter clone made in php with the Silex microframework.

* Overview

The =app= directory contains all the logic for the application, and =cfg= contains everything that has to be installed on the machine to set it up.

* Installation

Tweetlr is supplied as a [[http://vagrantup.com/][vagrant]] appliance, so once you have vagrant installed, you can create and provision a virtual machine with:

: vagrant up

Then just point your browser at [[http://localhost:8080/][http://localhost:8080/]]

To log in:

| username: | tweetlr |
| password: | passwd  |

Should you for any reason tire of the social media experience, you can remove all traces of it from your machine by typing:

: vagrant destroy
